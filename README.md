# Neighborhood-Similarity-Analysis-of-Mumbai-Delhi

This project elaborates on a data science project that attempts to analyze the neighborhoods in each of these two cities, 
and tries to understand what is popular in them and what they have to offer to someone who is contemplating to make a choice 
on seeking a life in either of the metro cities.
Mumbai and Delhi are the two major metro cities in India. There has been a war for supremacy in terms of quality of life, jobs, 
education, entertainment and recreational facilities that these cities have to offer to its residents. This   data science 
project  attempts to analyze the neighborhoods in each of these two cities and tries to understand what is popular in them and 
what they have to offer to someone who is contemplating to make a choice on seeking a life in either of the metro cities. 
The deciding factor for most would be on how lively, supportive, vibrant and unique each of the cities can be when compared to 
each other. 

The business problem in this study assumes that people who would be interested in this study are those who would like to 
create a projection of potential life and activities in these metro city neighborhoods if the subject moves to live in one of them. The decision to choose one over the other would depend on popular venues in the neighborhoods in each of these metro cities.
